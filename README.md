# Workout Tracker

This week's assignment had us creating a workout tracker. Our jobs was to build a website that connects to a mongo backend and a JavaScript front end. 

## 1. Homepage 

When you access the page, you will see your last workout. If you access this page and you haven't worked out before, it will be empty.
